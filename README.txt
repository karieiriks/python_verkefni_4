The script uses both guessit and requests package. So that has to be installed
before running the script.

Running the script :
	torrent_script.py "source path" "destination path"

Running the script with flag :
	torrent_script.py -i "source path "sestination path"

-i : The script will send http requests on "https://www.omdbapi.com/". Using this flag
will slow down the runtime of the script.
